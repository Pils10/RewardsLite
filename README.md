To compile the GitHub project [RewardsLite](https://github.com/pils10/RewardsLite) into a JAR file, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Maven build command to generate the JAR file.

Here are the commands you can use to accomplish this:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone -b papi-support https://github.com/marcelschoen/LitePlaytimeRewards.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd LitePlaytimeRewards

# Run Maven build
mvn clean install
```

After running these commands, you should find the JAR file in the `target` directory within the project folder. You can then move this JAR file to your plugins folder.
